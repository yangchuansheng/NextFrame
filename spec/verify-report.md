- Release build: PASS

## What works (manual walkthrough)
`verify.sh` does not launch `cargo run -p shell` or the recorder subprocess, so the walkthrough below is source-backed rather than automated UI proof.

1. Open `cargo run -p shell` → a `1440x900` Wry window opens.
2. The 5-zone CapCut-style layout loads: top menu, left library, center preview, right inspector, bottom timeline.
3. The preview plays the 30-second demo timeline automatically with the 5 shipped scenes on loop.
4. Drag a scene from the left library onto `V1` → a clip is created at the drop position.
5. Drag clip body to move, and drag clip edges to resize.
6. Press `B` for the Blade tool, then click a clip to split it.
7. Use `Shift`+click for multi-select, or drag a marquee box on empty timeline space to select multiple clips.
8. Press `Cmd+Z` to undo the last timeline action.
9. File → Save prompts for a `.nfproj` path and persists the current timeline.
10. File → Open loads an existing `.nfproj` file after validation.
11. File → Export opens the export dialog and can hand off MP4 generation to the recorder subprocess when that binary is available.

## Known issues / gaps
- MP4 export depends on an external recorder/ffmpeg toolchain. The bridge handles a missing recorder gracefully, but end-to-end export still depends on local setup.

## What's NOT implemented (out of scope)
- Transitions library
- Effect stack on clips
- Audio envelope editing
- Cross-platform (macOS only)
