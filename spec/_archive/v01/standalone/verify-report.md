## Features Shipped
### Phase A: Architecture (R1-R5)
- R1: Initialized the Cargo workspace, four-crate skeleton, and `runtime/web` scaffold.
- R2: Brought up the native Wry/Tao shell window and loaded the local web runtime.
- R3: Added the JSON-style JS↔Rust bridge for filesystem, scene, timeline, and logging calls.
- R4: Built the frame-pure render core, easing helpers, and timeline validation pipeline.
- R5: Ported the first five production scenes and wired the demo timeline into the engine.

### Phase B: UI Shell (R6-R12)
- R6: Replaced the placeholder page with the five-zone editor shell and dark desktop styling.
- R7: Implemented the top menu system plus New/Open/Save/Export project file flows.
- R8: Rendered the multi-track timeline UI with ruler, tracks, clips, zoom, and playhead visuals.
- R9: Mounted the DPR-aware preview canvas with letterboxing, safe areas, and render loop plumbing.
- R10: Shipped the library and inspector panels with live scene data and property editors.
- R11: Bootstrapped autoplay so the app opens with a looping demo timeline instead of a blank screen.
- R12: No standalone round file exists in this repo snapshot; shell work rolled forward into adjacent rounds.

### Phase C: Editing (R13-R19)
- R13: Enabled drag-and-drop from the scene library to create clips directly on timeline tracks.
- R14: Added clip body drag, edge resize, overlap protection, and minimum duration guards.
- R15: Introduced the Blade tool, clip splitting, shift multi-select, and marquee selection.
- R16: Added delete, copy, paste, duplicate, and keyboard shortcuts for core timeline editing.
- R17: Implemented magnetic snapping to grid, playhead, and neighboring clip edges.
- R18: No standalone round file exists; undo-oriented command work landed incrementally in nearby editing rounds.
- R19: No standalone round file exists in this repo snapshot; editing scope continued through later polish rounds.

### Phase D: Preview & Audio (R20-R23)
- R20: No standalone round file exists; playback behavior was delivered across preview bootstrap and transport polish work.
- R21: No standalone round file exists in this repo snapshot; preview/audio scope resumed in R22.
- R22: Added Web Audio mixing, clip waveform rendering, and multi-track playback plumbing.
- R23: Smoothed scrubbing with throttled preview renders and less noisy playhead mutation flow.

### Phase E: Export (R24-R26)
- R24: Exposed the `window.__onFrame` recorder contract for deterministic frame stepping and capture.
- R25: Wired File → Export to a recorder subprocess with presets, progress, and output handoff.
- R26: Added ffmpeg audio muxing so exported MP4 files can include mixed project audio.

### Phase F: Quality (R27-R30)
- R27: Built the headless BDD suite covering critical user scenarios with a custom JS runner.
- R28: Performed the architecture cleanup pass and added file-size checks for oversized modules.
- R29: Closed the lint and warning sweep across Rust and JavaScript quality gates.
- R30: Introduced the overnight verification report and scripted validation pipeline.
- R31: No standalone round file exists in this repo snapshot; numbering resumes at R32 for the polish pass.

### Polish: R32-R59
- R32: Added first-launch polish with the welcome overlay and keyboard hint treatment.
- R33: Expanded the scene library from 5 to 10 reusable frame-pure scenes.
- R34: Documented AI-driven operation and shipped a sample `.nfproj` welcome project.
- R35: Replaced placeholder scene cards with live-rendered library thumbnails.
- R36: Upgraded the preview transport controls with scrub bar, loop toggle, and volume UI.
- R37: Added timeline clip thumbnails so visual clips preview their hero frames inline.
- R38: Shipped an interactive first-run tutorial with anchored tooltips across the editor.
- R39: Added performance telemetry, frame-drop tracking, and a 60fps monitoring hook.
- R40: Added a synced project title bar with filename and dirty-state indicator.
- R41: Added clip color labels and freeform notes in the inspector.
- R42: Added one-click randomized scene params driven by each scene schema.
- R43: Added the project stats strip for clip counts, duration, categories, and dirty state.
- R44: Added toast notifications for save, export, and error feedback.
- R45: Added favorite scenes with persistence and top-of-library prioritization.
- R46: Added a clickable timeline minimap for fast navigation across long projects.
- R47: Added persistent recent files in the File menu via the Rust bridge.
- R48: Added a Cmd+K command palette for keyboard-first control of editor actions.
- R49: Added switchable color themes including the Velvet and Ice presets.
- R50: Added autosave with background snapshots and recovery-oriented bridge endpoints.
- R51: Added a dedicated live-editable text scene for title and overlay work.
- R52: Added project aspect ratio presets for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and cinematic output.
- R53: Added the `imageHero` scene with Ken Burns-style motion on still images.
- R54: Made track mute, solo, and lock controls functional in editor state and rendering.
- R55: Added loop-region in/out markers with draggable playback boundaries.
- R56: Added right-click context menus for clips, tracks, and other editor surfaces.
- R57: Added the bottom status bar with cursor time, tool state, selection, and autosave status.
- R58: Added the `shapeBurst` motion graphics scene for geometric burst animation.
- R59: Added the `fluidBackground` scene for animated soft-glow abstract backdrops.

## Try It Now
1. `cd NextFrame`
2. `cargo run -p shell`
3. The window opens, scenes auto-play
4. Press `Cmd+K` to open the command palette.
5. Press `B` for blade tool, click a clip to split
6. Try `View > Theme > Velvet` for purple aesthetic
7. `File > Export` to start to render MP4

## What works (manual walkthrough)
`verify.sh` does not launch `cargo run -p shell` or the recorder subprocess, so the walkthrough below is source-backed rather than automated UI proof.

1. Launch `cargo run -p shell` and let the `1440x900` Wry window settle on the autoplaying demo timeline.
2. Call out the editor shell: top menu, scene library, preview canvas, inspector, and multi-track timeline.
3. Show that scenes are live by dragging a library card onto `V1`, then move and resize the created clip.
4. Press `B`, split a clip, then use `Shift`+click or a marquee drag to show multi-select editing.
5. Hit `Cmd+K` for the command palette and switch `View > Theme > Velvet` to show the polished shell variants.
6. Open File actions to show Save/Open, recent files, autosave support, and export entry points.
7. Finish in the timeline: loop a region, inspect clip params, and point out thumbnails, stats, and status feedback.
8. Start File → Export and explain that MP4 output works when the recorder and ffmpeg toolchain are installed.

## Known issues / gaps
- BDD suite skipped 3 scenario(s); this run is not a clean all-green behavioral sweep.

## What's NOT implemented (out of scope)
- Transitions library
- Effect stack on clips
- Audio envelope editing
- Cross-platform (macOS only)
